# wolfi-docker-dind

Container image containing
[Docker-in-Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/docker-in-docker-containerized-ci-workflows-dockercon-2023/).

Based on WolfiOS and built using the
[apko-publish](https://github.com/chainguard-images/actions/tree/main/apko-publish)
GitHub Action.

## Licensing

The container image contains software packages that are direct or transitive
dependencies. As renovate is the most prominent one, I have taken its license
`AGPL-3.0-only` as a license for this repository, too.
